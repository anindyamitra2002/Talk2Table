# Talk2Table  

## Overview  
**Talk2Table** is an intelligent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that allows users to interact with uploaded CSV data stored in an SQLite database. It uses OpenAI's GPT-based models for generating SQL queries and analyzing data, enabling users to ask natural language questions and receive comprehensive answers, including SQL queries, data tables, summaries, and visualizations.  

With Talk2Table, you can effortlessly extract insights from your data without writing any SQL or complex scripts.

## How It Works  

### 1. Upload Data  
Users can upload their data in the form of a CSV file. Once uploaded, the data is automatically imported into an SQLite database, ensuring quick and efficient access for querying and analysis.  

### 2. Query with Natural Language  
Simply type your questions in plain English. The system uses OpenAIâ€™s GPT-based models to interpret your query and generate a corresponding SQL command.  

### 3. Retrieve Table Data  
The SQL query is executed on the uploaded data, and the retrieved results are displayed in tabular format. You can view the specific rows or aggregated data that answer your query.  

### 4. Visualization  
The retrieved data can also be visualized as interactive charts using Plotly. This allows users to gain deeper insights into their data with clear and visually appealing representations.  

### 5. Similar Questions  
The system suggests follow-up questions based on the context of your query and retrieved data. This feature encourages exploratory data analysis and helps users uncover additional insights from their data.

## Features  

### Similar Questions  
The system generates follow-up questions to guide users toward exploring their data more effectively. This feature ensures a conversational and intuitive experience for data interaction.  

### Plotly Visualizations  
Data can be displayed as interactive charts and graphs, enabling users to analyze trends, patterns, and insights visually.  

### Table Retrieval  
Query results are displayed as structured data tables, providing precise and actionable insights. Users can easily explore their dataset row by row or in aggregated form.  

### Natural Language to SQL Generation  
The system translates natural language queries into SQL commands automatically, removing the need for SQL knowledge and making data querying accessible to everyone.  

### Configurable Outputs  
Users can choose what to display, such as SQL queries, tables, visualizations, and summaries, to tailor the output to their needs.  

### Easy Cleanup  
Automatically clears previous databases and ensures a clean workspace for every session.
